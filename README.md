# knotepad
This is intended as a simple 'notepad' like application. It's not 
inteded to replace KWrite or any of the other similar apps.
Not sure if anyone will be interested in this but if they are, please
feel free to download, try it and provide feedback.

Currently at this time the app is not in working order and is pre-alpha.
The base code was taken from the kxmlgui-tutoral page and modified from there :)
